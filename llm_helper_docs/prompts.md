Prompts
Create reusable prompt templates and workflows

Prompts enable servers to define reusable prompt templates and workflows that clients can easily surface to users and LLMs. They provide a powerful way to standardize and share common LLM interactions.

Prompts are designed to be user-controlled, meaning they are exposed from servers to clients with the intention of the user being able to explicitly select them for use.

​
Overview
Prompts in MCP are predefined templates that can:

Accept dynamic arguments
Include context from resources
Chain multiple interactions
Guide specific workflows
Surface as UI elements (like slash commands)
​
Prompt structure
Each prompt is defined with:


Copy
{
  name: string;              // Unique identifier for the prompt
  description?: string;      // Human-readable description
  arguments?: [              // Optional list of arguments
    {
      name: string;          // Argument identifier
      description?: string;  // Argument description
      required?: boolean;    // Whether argument is required
    }
  ]
}
​
Discovering prompts
Clients can discover available prompts through the prompts/list endpoint:


Copy
// Request
{
  method: "prompts/list"
}

// Response
{
  prompts: [
    {
      name: "analyze-code",
      description: "Analyze code for potential improvements",
      arguments: [
        {
          name: "language",
          description: "Programming language",
          required: true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
​
Using prompts
To use a prompt, clients make a prompts/get request:


Copy
// Request
{
  method: "prompts/get",
  params: {
    name: "analyze-code",
    arguments: {
      language: "python"
    }
  }
}

// Response
{
  description: "Analyze Python code for potential improvements",
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: {
        type: "text",
        text: "Please analyze the following Python code for potential improvements:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_sum(numbers):\n    total = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        total = total + num\n    return total\n\nresult = calculate_sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\nprint(result)\n```"
      }
    }
  ]
}

Dynamic prompts
Prompts can be dynamic and include:
