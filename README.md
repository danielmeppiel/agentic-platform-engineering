## 1. Getting Started

### 1.1 Setup GitHub Authentication

This MCP Server supports two authentication methods with GitHub:
1. GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) - Simpler setup, suitable for testing and personal use
2. GitHub App - More secure, recommended for production use and organization-wide deployment

#### Option 1: GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)

> [!WARNING] 
> Use a PAT for testing and development purposes only. For production use, authenticate with a GitHub App.

The simplest way to get started is using a GitHub Personal Access Token:

1. Create a new PAT in GitHub:
   - Go to your GitHub Settings
   - Navigate to "Developer settings" > "Personal access tokens" > "Tokens (classic)"
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Grant the following permissions:
     - `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
     - `workflow` (Update GitHub Action workflows)
   - Copy the generated token

2. Set the token in your environment:
   - Save the token as `GITHUB_PAT` environment variable
   - This is the only authentication variable you need when using PAT

#### Option 2: GitHub App (Recommended for Organizations)

For production use and better security, create and configure a GitHub App:

1. Create a new GitHub App in your Organization:
   - Go to your Organization's Settings
   - Navigate to "GitHub Apps" under "Developer settings", Click "New GitHub App"
   - Fill in the following details:
     - GitHub App name: e.g., "Platform Engineering MCP"
     - Homepage URL: Your organization's URL
     - Webhook: Disable (not required)
     - Repository permissions:
        - Contents: Read & write
        - Metadata: Read-only
        - Actions: Read & write
        - Administration: Read & write
   - Click "Create GitHub App"

2. Generate a private key for your GitHub App:
   - After creation, scroll down to the "Private keys" section and click "Generate a private key"
   - Save the downloaded .pem file securely

3. Install the GitHub App in your Organization:
   - On the GitHub App settings page, click "Install App"
   - Select the Organization where you want to install the app
   - Choose repositories:
     - Either select "All repositories"
     - Or select specific repositories including your PE configuration repository
   - Click "Install"

4. Write down the following environment variables:
    - `GITHUB_APP_ID`: Found in the GitHub App's settings page (displayed as "App ID")
    - `GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY`: The contents of the .pem file you downloaded
      - Open the .pem file
      - Copy all contents including "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----" and "-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
      - Replace newlines with "\n" in the .env file, ask Copilot to do this for you! 
    - `GITHUB_INSTALLATION_ID`: Found in the URL when you installed the app
      - Go to Organization Settings > GitHub Apps > Your App > Configure
      - The number in the URL after "installations/" is your installation ID
    - `PE_CONFIG_REPO`: Your organization's platform engineering configuration repository
      - Format: "organization-name/repository-name"

### 1.2 Setup your Engineering Platform on GitHub

In the organization where you have installed the GitHub App, you must either create or choose an existing repository as the one which will hold your engineering platform's configuration file. In your chosen repository:

  1. Create a file called `pe.yaml`.
  2. Copy and paste the contents of the `config/pe.yaml` example file in this repo. This is just a starter example that you must edit.
  3. Edit your `pe.yaml` file to point to your repository templates. [GitHub's documentation on creating repository templates](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository).
  4. Edit your `pe.yaml` file to point to GitHub Organizations from where you want to source GitHub Actions workflow templates. These must be located under the `.github` repo's `workflow-templates` folder in each of the Organizations you add. [GitHub's documentation on creating workflow templates for your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/sharing-automations/creating-workflow-templates-for-your-organization). 

### 1.3 Setup the MCP Server in VSCode Insiders

In VSCode Insiders, add a new MCP Server to your User Settings JSON file. You can use either authentication method:

#### Option 1: Using GitHub Personal Access Token

```json
"mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "platform-eng-copilot": {
        "command": "node",
        "args": [
            "<ABSOLUTE_PATH>/platform-eng-copilot/dist/server.js"
        ],
        "env": {
          "GITHUB_PAT": "<YOUR_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>",
          "PE_CONFIG_REPO":"<YOUR_GITHUB_ORG>/<YOUR_REPO_WITH_PE_YAML_FILE>"
        }
      }
   }
}
```

#### Option 2: Using GitHub App Authentication

```json
"mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "platform-eng-copilot": {
        "command": "node",
        "args": [
            "<ABSOLUTE_PATH>/platform-eng-copilot/dist/server.js"
        ],
        "env": {
          "GITHUB_APP_ID": "<YOUR_GITHUB_APP_ID>",
          "GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY":"<YOUR_GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_WITH_NO_BREAKLINES>",
          "GITHUB_INSTALLATION_ID":"<YOUR_GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID>",
          "PE_CONFIG_REPO":"<YOUR_GITHUB_ORG>/<YOUR_REPO_WITH_PE_YAML_FILE>"
        }
      }
   }
}
```

Make sure to replace all values between "<>" brackets with your actual configuration values. Only configure one authentication method - either PAT or GitHub App credentials.

### 1.4 (Optional) Inspecting locally with MCP Inspector

If you want to quickly debug this MCP server, create your .env file based on .env.example and then run locally with MCP Inspector:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npx env-cmd -f .env npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node dist/server.js
```

## 2. Usage

**Option 1: Pre-baked PE workflows**:
> [!NOTE] 
> Using this MCP Server with VSCode won't allow you to use the implemented [MCP Prompts](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/server/prompts/), as MCP Prompts are [not yet supported on VSCode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/244173). 

Use [VSCode Reusable prompts](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_reusable-prompt-files-experimental) with the prompt files made available in this repo under `.github/prompts`. Think about these as recipes set up by your PE Admins which will guide the LLM in a standardized fashion. 

For example, attach the `scenario-1-repo.prompt.md` prompt file in `.github/prompts` to the context and send it to GitHub Copilot. 

**Option 2: Simple prompting:**

Simply ask GitHub Copilot to help you with a task such as:

>_Create a new repo for me based on a official template from my organization_

>_Set up CI/CD for my repo respecting my organization's standards_

>_Create a deployment environment for my microservices app using AKS based on approved templates_

### 2.1 Pre-baked PE Workflows 

**Value Proposition**: Automate the creation of standardized, compliant projects in minutes instead of hours.

**Reusable Prompt**: `.github/prompts/scenario-1-repo.prompt.md`

**Workflow**:
1. Developer expresses intent to create a new project
2. LLM gathers requirements through natural conversation
3. PE MCP Server provides appropriate templates based on requirements
4. LLM recommends best template and explains reasoning
5. Upon confirmation, GitHub MCP creates repository from template
6. LLM recommends appropriate CI/CD workflows from PE MCP Server
7. GitHub MCP configures workflows
8. LLM offers to provision test environment
9. Azure MCP provisions resources if requested

### 2.2 Environment Provisioning

**Value Proposition**: Standardize environment creation across teams with built-in compliance and best practices.

**Reusable Prompt**: `.github/prompts/scenario-2-env.prompt.md`

**Workflow**:
1. Developer requests environment for existing project
2. LLM determines project type and requirements
3. PE MCP Server provides appropriate environment templates
4. LLM recommends best template and explains reasoning
5. Upon confirmation, Azure MCP provisions resources
6. LLM summarizes provisioned resources and provides access information

## 3. Architecture Overview

This guide outlines an architecture for leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create a powerful Platform Engineering experience through AI agents. By combining MCP's tools, prompts, and client-server architecture, we can create seamless, standardized workflows that automate complex platform engineering tasks while maintaining the human-in-the-loop element essential for critical decisions.

The architecture consists of three primary components:

1. **Client LLM Interface**: The entry point for users (GitHub Copilot in VS Code or GitHub.com)
2. **PE MCP Server**: The orchestration layer that defines workflows and exposes platform engineering capabilities
3. **Product-specific MCP Servers**: Specialized servers for GitHub, Azure, and other tools

1. **Prompts as Workflow Templates**: The PE MCP Server defines standardized prompt templates that guide both the LLM and user through complex platform engineering tasks. These prompts surface as discoverable, interactive elements.

   When a prompt is returned to the LLM, it includes structured guidance that helps the LLM:
   - Break down complex tasks into discrete steps
   - Select appropriate MCP tools from different servers (GitHub MCP, Azure MCP, etc.)
   - Maintain context across multiple tool invocations
   - Follow standardized workflows while adapting to specific requirements
   - Know when to seek user confirmation for critical decisions

2. **Tools for Concrete Actions**: Each action (creating repositories, configuring workflows, provisioning resources) is implemented as an MCP tool with well-defined parameters and validation, allowing the LLM to execute operations securely.

3. **Client-Server Architecture**: Following MCP's design, each service (PE, GitHub, Azure) runs as a separate server that exposes its capabilities through prompts and tools. The Client LLM acts as the coordinator, maintaining individual connections with each server.

4. **Human-in-the-Loop Control**: The workflow preserves MCP's human oversight model - all key decisions (template selection, workflow choices, environment provisioning) require explicit user confirmation before tools are invoked.

This approach ensures standardization while maintaining MCP's security principles and keeping humans in control of critical platform engineering decisions.

## 5. MCP Components and Their Value

### 5.1 MCP Prompts: Guided Workflows

MCP Prompts are essential for providing structured guidance to both the user and the LLM:

1. **Value in Platform Engineering**:
   - **Workflow Standardization**: Prompts define consistent workflows across the organization
   - **Guided Experience**: Step-by-step templates guide users through complex processes
   - **Context Preservation**: Maintain context throughout multi-step processes
   - **Discoverability**: Prompts appear as slash commands in supporting clients

2. **Implementation Approach**:
   - Define high-level workflow prompts that outline the entire process
   - Include dynamic parameters based on user requirements
   - Structure prompts as conversations that guide both user and LLM
   - Design prompts to anticipate common decision points

### 5.2 MCP Tools: Executable Capabilities

MCP Tools enable concrete actions and information retrieval:

1. **Value in Platform Engineering**:
   - **Action Execution**: Perform operations on GitHub, Azure, and other systems
   - **Information Retrieval**: Fetch available templates and configuration options
   - **Standardization**: Ensure operations follow organization standards
   - **Security**: Properly scoped tools with parameter validation

## 6. Configuration Repository

The PE MCP Server reads from a central configuration repository that contains YAML files defining available templates such as: GitHub Repository templates, GitHub Actions workflow templates or Azure Deployment Environment templates:

```yaml
# templates.yaml
templates:
  repositories:
    - name: java-springboot-microservice
      description: "Spring Boot microservice with OAuth2 security and API documentation"
